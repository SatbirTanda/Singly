# Singly

## *Singly /ˈsiNGɡlē/ adverb - one at a time; separately or individually.*

Written in Swift 2.0, Singly is my first iOS game.  I made Singly because I wanted to make a small game based on my life and because I wanted to learn the basics of Game Design and Development.  In this project, I learned about SpriteKit, the Game Loop, and particle collisions.

The actaul nature of the game is to turn off the lights in the morning and to turn them on at the night.  This becomes progressively harder because the days and nights start to pass faster and faster every 7 rounds.

Here's a demo of my game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37pUw5Bt_bQ

This app was released in early 2016 with XCode 7.0 because of its swift 2.0 compiler.
