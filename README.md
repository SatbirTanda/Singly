# Singly

## *Singly /ˈsiNGɡlē/ adverb - one at a time; separately or individually.*

Written in Swift 2.0, Singly is my first iOS game.  I made Singly because I wanted to make a small game based on my life and because I wanted to learn the basics of Game Design and Development.  In this project, I learned about SpriteKit, the Game Loop, and particle collisions.

This app was released in early 2016 with XCode 7.0 because of its swift 2.0 compiler.
